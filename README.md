# 🚀 AI Platform Engineer — BotZaVOD

I am an **AI Platform Engineer (GPU / LLM Infrastructure)** building **architecture-level systems**
for distributed compute, orchestration, and diagnostics-first AI platforms.

It is designed as a **foundational AI infrastructure layer**, not a single application,
with a strong focus on **GPU/LLM infrastructure**, scalability, observability,
and **diagnostics-first autonomous orchestration**.

### 🎯 What I Do

I design and build **AI platform & LLM infrastructure**, focusing on:

- distributed GPU / LLM systems  
- accelerator orchestration (CUDA, hybrid, local + remote)  
- memory & context pipelines  
- diagnostics-first, production-oriented architectures

### 🚀 Flagship Platform

I am the architect and creator of **BotZaVOD** — a foundational AI platform engine for distributed GPU/CPU/LLM systems.

BotZaVOD is designed as a **universal, modular, and autonomous core** for building scalable AI infrastructures, not isolated applications.

# 🚀 BotZaVOD — Distributed AI/LLM Platform Engine  
**(Main Architecture · GPU/LLM/Memory Engine · Multi-Node System)**  
Repository: https://github.com/SAE8/botzavod-github-lite

BotZaVOD is a modular distributed engine designed for:

- GPU routing (CUDA, MMQ, INT8/FP16 offload)  
- LLaMA/Mistral local inference via llama.cpp  
- cloud/local hybrid GPT switching  
- multi-node compute over Tailscale  
- memory: long-term + short-term separation  
- system diagnostics & telemetry  
- autonomous module management  
- real-time observability and safe control  

It serves as a **cognitive cloud processor**, unifying compute, reasoning, acceleration, and diagnostics into a single engine.

# 🧬 Quantum Core Lite — Quantum-Inspired Accelerators  
**(Shor · Grover · HHL · Optimization & Noise Models)**  
Repository: https://github.com/SAE8/botzavod-quantum-core-lite

This package provides simplified public versions of the quantum-inspired engines from BotZaVOD:

- `shor_engine.py` — factorization demo  
- `grover_engine.py` — search acceleration  
- `hhl_solver.py` — linear-equation solver  
- `dolce_engine.py` — gradient optimizer  
- `yota_engine.py` — noise-reduction  
- `kva_kva_engine.py` — resonance-based compute  

These accelerators demonstrate the architecture of a **multi-engine compute pipeline** used inside the internal BotZaVOD system.
