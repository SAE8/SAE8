# Evgenii “Moisey” Semenov  
AI Platform Engineer · GPU/LLM Architect · Quantum-Inspired Systems

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I build modular, distributed AI systems that combine:
- GPU/CPU acceleration  
- LLaMA/Mistral/Hybrid GPT routing  
- memory & reasoning engines  
- multi-node orchestration over Tailscale  
- autonomous agents  
- quantum-inspired accelerator modules  
- full diagnostics & observability  

My work is centered around scalable AI infrastructure and next-generation compute pipelines.

# 🚀 BotZaVOD — Distributed AI/LLM Platform Engine  
**(Main Architecture · GPU/LLM/Memory Engine · Multi-Node System)**  
Repository: https://github.com/SAE8/botzavod-github-lite

BotZaVOD is a modular distributed engine designed for:

- GPU routing (CUDA, MMQ, INT8/FP16 offload)  
- LLaMA/Mistral local inference via llama.cpp  
- cloud/local hybrid GPT switching  
- multi-node compute over Tailscale  
- memory: long-term + short-term separation  
- system diagnostics & telemetry  
- autonomous module management  
- real-time observability and safe control  

It serves as a **cognitive cloud processor**, unifying compute, reasoning, acceleration, and diagnostics into a single engine.

# 🧬 Quantum Core Lite — Quantum-Inspired Accelerators  
**(Shor · Grover · HHL · Optimization & Noise Models)**  
Repository: https://github.com/SAE8/botzavod-quantum-core-lite

This package provides simplified public versions of the quantum-inspired engines from BotZaVOD:

- `shor_engine.py` — factorization demo  
- `grover_engine.py` — search acceleration  
- `hhl_solver.py` — linear-equation solver  
- `dolce_engine.py` — gradient optimizer  
- `yota_engine.py` — noise-reduction  
- `kva_kva_engine.py` — resonance-based compute  

These accelerators demonstrate the architecture of a **multi-engine compute pipeline** used inside the internal BotZaVOD system.
